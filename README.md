# ⚙️ SAWBLADES

**SAWBLADES** is an arcade-style survival game developed using Python.

I built this project to reinforce my **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** and **game mechanics** understanding alongside a **Udemy Python Bootcamp** course.

### 🚀 Features

- **Dynamic Obstacles:** Sawblades appear and move across the screen at varying speeds.
- **Collision Detection:** Instant game-over mechanics upon contact with a blade.
- **Increasing Difficulty:** The game becomes more challenging as you progress.
- **OOP Design:** Modular code structure separating the player, obstacles, and game loop.
